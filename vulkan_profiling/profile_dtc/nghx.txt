                                        choose either metric-set-name or 
                                        metric-set-id, must also specify

  --multi-pass-metrics                  When enabled, additional hardware 
                                        counters will be collected over 
                                        multiple frames. Additional metrics 
                                        based on these counters will be shown 
                                        in the metrics tables, and richer 
                                        expert-system advice will be shown in 
                                        the Trace Analysis view.
  --advanced-mode                       Alias of "multi-pass-metrics", 
                                        deprecated
  --lock-gpu-clocks arg (=1)            Lock GPU clocks during trace.
  --disable-nvtx-ranges arg (=0)        Disables NVTX ranges. NVTX ranges allow
                                        the application to create markers 
                                        around queue submits using the NVTX 
                                        API, however this may introduce 
                                        additional overhead.
  --collect-screenshot arg (=1)         When enabled, a screenshot of the 
                                        target application will be collected 
                                        and displayed in the Summary page.
  --capture-screenshot arg              (deprecated). Same as 
                                        collect-screenshot
  --time-every-action                   When enabled, individual actions will 
                                        be timed separately instead of being 
                                        coalesced with adjacent actions of the 
                                        same kind. Enabling this option will 
                                        result in a performance penalty.
  --real-time-shader-profiler           When enabled, source-level shader 
                                        performance will be revealed per ~10 
                                        usec interval in the Top-Down Calls 
                                        table and other shader profiler views. 
                                        Shader performance is collected via a 
                                        high-speed sampling profiler in the SM 
                                        hardware, which incurs no shader 
                                        execution overhead at runtime, and only
                                        consumes PCIe TX bandwidth (along with 
                                        perf counters). When disabled, a more 
                                        detailed list of SM and L1TEX perf 
                                        counters will be collected.
  --disable-collect-shader-pipelines    Disable collection of Shader Pipelines.
                                        If Shader Pipeline collection is 
                                        enabled the Shader Pipelines view will 
                                        list all PSOs, shader code will be 
                                        available for browsing, the Top-Down 
                                        Calls tree will contain the static 
                                        inlined call graph, and the Ray Tracing
                                        Live State view will be populated. When
                                          Shader Pipeline collection is 
                                        disabled, the Shader Pipelines, Shader 
                                        Source, and Top-Down Calls trees will 
                                        be empty.
  --disable-collect-external-shader-debug-info 
                                        Disable collection of external shader 
                                        debug info in the trace. If collection 
                                        of external shader debug info is 
                                        enabled, GPU Trace will try to resolve 
                                        debug information for shaders without 
                                        pre-embedded debug information on the 
                                        target application. Any found debug 
                                        information will be embedded in the 
                                        trace report. 
  --pc-samples-per-pm-interval-per-sm arg
                                        The sampling interval in cycles, for 
                                        the hardware sampling profiler in the 
                                        SM. This is referenced to the GPC clock
                                        frequency, which may run at the boost 
                                        clock. If you see a warning message 
                                        that the hardware dropped samples, try 
                                        increasing this interval. Must be a 
                                        power of 2; minimum 32.
  --pm-bandwidth-limit arg              The maximum background traffic incurred
                                        by PM Counters and Warp State Sampling.
                                         
  --disable-trace-shader-bindings       Disable collection of shader hashes as 
                                        part of the trace.
